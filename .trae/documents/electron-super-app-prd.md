# Electron Super App - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

A powerful Electron-based super app that enables users to install, manage, and run mini-applications (plugins) within a unified desktop environment, similar to VS Code's extension system but for general-purpose applications.

The platform solves the problem of application fragmentation by providing a single workspace where users can access multiple specialized tools and utilities. Target users include developers, power users, and organizations seeking a customizable desktop application platform with extensible functionality.

The product aims to create a thriving ecosystem of mini-apps while maintaining security, performance, and user experience standards comparable to modern IDE platforms.

3. User installs desired plugins with one-click installation
4. User returns to Dashboard to launch installed mini-apps
5. User manages plugins through Plugin Manager (enable/disable/update)
6. User customizes experience through Settings

**Plugin Developer Flow:**
1. Developer enables Developer Mode in Settings
2. Developer accesses Developer Console for plugin creation
3. Developer uses scaffolding tools to create plugin structure
4. Developer builds and tests plugin locally using debug interface
5. Developer packages plugin for distribution
6. Developer uploads plugin to marketplace for public access

**Administrator Flow:**
1. Administrator accesses system configuration through Settings
